## Notes for going through the Kubernetes in Action
### Chapter 4
##### Create replication controller
```bash
k create -f ./kubia-rc.yml
```

### Chapter 5
##### Create service
```bash
k create -f ./kubia-svc.yml
```
##### Get Service
```bash
k get service
```
##### Test service from another pod
```bash
k exec <pod_name> -- curl -s http://<svc_ip>
```
##### Service Endpoints
These are the resource which routes traffic from clients to the pods which are part of the service. The selector in the service config is used to build a list of endpoints (IPs and ports) and this is used to route the traffic to the pod.
<br>
You can check the endpoint like any other resource:
```bash
k get endpoint kubia
```
##### Create node port
This is a mapping of a k8s node port to a port for a pod
````bash
k create -f ./nodeport.yml
````

#### Ingress
Maps an ingress controller to a pod. Operates on <u>layer 7</u> so has the flexibility to route hostname/app1 and hostname/app2 to different services and therefore pods.
<br>
Requires an ingress controller. This can be enabled with minikube with `minikube addons enable ingress`. Get the IP of the controller with `minikube service list` - you're looking for the "default-http-backend"
<br>
The below will route requests to the `host/test` value of the template to `kubia-nodeport` service
```bash
k create -f ./ingress.yml
```
<b>Note:</b> You can test this using cURL:<br>
`curl -X GET 'http://minikube.eddy.com/test`
<br>or<br>
`curl -X GET 'http://<IP_OF_INGRESS_CONTROLLER>/test -H 'Host: minikube.eddy.com'`
<br>
(Where the host is whatever is specified in the ingress object)

###### Note how ingresses works
1. Request is sent to URL (eg minikube.eddy.com/test)
2. DNS resolves this to the IP of the ingress controller
3. Client sends HTTP request to the ingress controller with `minikube.eddy.com` in the host header
4. From the header, the controller determines the service that the client is trying to access, looked up the pod IPs via the Endpoints object associated with the service and forwarded the request to one of the pods.
<b>Note:</b> The ingress controller doesn't forward requests to the service, rather it gets the endpoints from the service and forwards to the pods directly. Most ingress controllers work like this.

##### Enabling HTTPS for an ingress
1. Create a self signed certificate and key (page 241 // 147)
```bash
openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj /CN=minikube.eddy.com
```
2. Then create a secret from the 2 files
```bash
k create secret tls tls-secret --cert=tls.cert --key=tls.key
```

3. Deploy the app using the following template:
```bash
k create -f ingress-tls.yml
```
or if the deployment already exists, update it:
```bash
k apply -f ingress-tls.yml
```

#### Readiness Probes
- A failed readiness probe removes the pod IP from the list of endpoints for the associated service.
- They will not kill or restart a container. Liveness probes will but readiness probes won't.
- You configure a time to wait before the readiness probe starts polling.
- The readiness probe polls at certain intervals (10 seconds by default).
- An example of where you'd use one:
  - Your app has front end pods which connect to a back end database.
  - Your front end pods have connectivity problems to the database
  - You'd want the readiness probe to fail, which would remove the pod IP from the service (but not kill the pod).
  - This is different to a liveness probe which (if it had the same check) would kill the pod - even though there's nothing wrong with the pod.
  
#### Run a single pod with the dnsutils tools, on the fly
```bash
k run dnsutils --image=tutum/dnsutils --generator=run-pod/v1 --command -- sleep infinity
```
Note: the `--generator=run-pod/v1` part tells K8s to create a pod without a replication controller or similar behind it.
