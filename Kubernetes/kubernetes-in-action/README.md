## Notes for going through the Kubernetes in Action
### Chapter 4
##### Create replication controller
```bash
k create -f ./kubia-rc.yml
```

### Chapter 5
##### Create service
```bash
k create -f ./kubia-svc.yml
```
##### Get Service
```bash
k get service
```
##### Test service from another pod
```bash
k exec <pod_name> -- curl -s http://<svc_ip>
```
##### Service Endpoints
These are the resource which routes traffic from clients to the pods which are part of the service. The selector in the service config is used to build a list of endpoints (IPs and ports) and this is used to route the traffic to the pod.
<br>
You can check the endpoint like any other resource:
```bash
k get endpoint kubia
```
##### Create node port
This is a mapping of a k8s node port to a port for a pod
````bash
k create -f ./nodeport.yml
````
